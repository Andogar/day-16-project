## Scope, hoisting and compartmentalization

### Answer the following:
In you own words, explain the concepts of scope, hoisting, compartmentalization.

Scope is the area that a variable or object can be accessed in. If you try to access an item outside of it's scope, it won't exist. Hoisting brings things to the top of the page so that javascript can run it first, like a variable declaration at the top but the assignment of the variable is not until you created it. Compartmentalization is the act of specifically keeping variables or functions incertain scopes to ensure that others cannot access it.

### Provide examples for all three, below:

#### Scope:
A variable created inside the function cannot be called outside of the function since it's in a local or private scope.
#### Hoisting:
Variable declarations are brought to the top of the document and created first and then assigned a value when you create them.
#### Compartmentalization:
A variable intentionally created in the function so that it cannot be called upon outside of the function to ensure nobody else can adjust it or make changes.
